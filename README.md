## Inspiration
Everyday I read something which I think are very important, specially in [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com). Usually, I would send such article/post to myself so that later I can follow up, but it turns out that, these posts have piled up so big that I can hardly find them when I need. So I prompted [manus.ai](www.manus.ai) and adjusted few things to track them easily. 

This project was also inspired by the need for a comprehensive, visual way to track reading progress and gain insights into learning patterns.
